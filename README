If an ssh user has sshtun as a shell, a file ~/.hushlogin must exist to prevent motd from breaking the comunication.

Installing on a new system:
1. Compile
2. Create a new user: adduser --system --disabled-password sshvpn
3. Configure:
	On a node that can be connected:
	1. Set sshvpn as a shell of sshvpn user
	2. Create ~sshvpn/.hushlogin
	3. Fill ~sshvpn/.ssh/authorized_keys

	On a node that can make outgoing connections:
	1. Fill ~sshvpn/.ssh/known_hosts
	2. Copy private key (~sshvpn/.ssh/id_rsa)
4. Run: sudo sshvpn --server config.ini
